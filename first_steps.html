	<h1>First Steps</h1>
	<p>If you haven't done any game design before, this is the place to be for a basic guide to getting started</p>
	<hr>
	<br>
	<h1>1. Know what you want to make</h1>
	<p>One of the largest hurdles for game design, is knowing what your making, if you know exactly what you want to create, you will be able to plan around your idea, for instance; if you want to create a 2D platformer with very little advanced mechanics or graphics, you would avoid Unreal Engine 4 as it's focus is more around the high poly and generally more advanced mechanics.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>2. Pick the right engine for you</h1>
	<p>As the world of game design is a vast place, with many different specialties, it is important to choose the right engine for your idea, as some leading engines such as Cryengine, and Unreal Engine 4 focus primarily on the accesibility of advanced mechanics and graphics. While other engines, such as Scratch and Gamemaker, have a much more accesible system in place to assist new programmers in creating basic games to build experience.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>3. Create a Minimum Viable Product</h1>
	<p>Nothing is worse than spending hours creating your game only to have nothing to show for it. That is why you should create a Minimum Viable Product of your idea, that means a core mechanic to your game, whether that be a game mechanic, or a landscape. It all depends on your idea. Creating that MVP will give you a sense of progress and achievement that will keep you motivated to keep creating. This step can also be repeated an unlimited number of times if you're introducing a new part, as it can help you tracm progress too.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>4. Use the internet</h1>
	<p>Belive it or not, professional game designers and developers still use the internet to help with their projects, as sometimes a fix to a bug just simply escapes your mind. Given that the internet is the host to the greatest library of information, you are also likely to find tutorials to help with your journey as well!</p>
	<br>
	<h1>5. Share your progress</h1>
	<p>This one is a no brainer, yes it may be difficult to share something you made with a friend, especially if it isn't a totally finished product. But this step will allow you to get feedback from them and improve your idea. This step is also crucial to testing your game as they may find bugs that you haven't or surprising loopholes that you didn't think of.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>6. Enjoy your work</h1>
	<p>If you don't like something, why would you do it? The same goes for your project. If you aren't enjoying what you're making, or you aren't enjoying making it, take a break or rethink the ideas you had, what's working for you and what isn't? Because in the end, odds are you aren't getting paid to create your first ever game, you're doing it because you feel like making it, not becausee someone told you to.</p>
